Code for "An Active Inference Model of the Optimisim Bias" In this paper propose a domain general model of the optimism bias as precision over a positive outcome, which can be applied in different task settings. Through simulation we show how optimism may be lost during development by exposure to negative events (Experiment 1). We then ground our  model in the empirical literature showing how developmentally acquired differences in optimism are expressed in a  belief updating task used to measure optimism bias (Experiment 2). Finally, we show how optimism affects action in a modified two-armed bandit task (Experiment 3). Our model and the simulations it affords provide a computational basis for understanding how optimism bias may emerge, how it may be expressed in standard tasks used to assess optimism, and how it affects agentsâ€™ decision-making and actions; in combination, this provides a basis for future research on optimism as a mental health intervention.
